## Checklist
### Basics
- [x] I have three HTML files named `index.html`, `works.html`, `contact.html`.
- [x] My images have sensible names and are likely stored in a folder called `images`.
- [x] My images are optimised (likely as JPG or PNG images).
- [x] I have a CSS file with a sensible name.
- [x] I have validated each of my HTML and CSS files.

<br />

### For each of my HTML files
#### Frontmatter
- [x] My doctype is specified as HTML as the first line: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- [x] I have opening and closing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags.
- [x] My language is specified as English: `<html lang="en">`.
- [x] I have `<meta>` tags for: `charset`, `author`, `description`, and `viewport` for each page, where the description is unique to each page.
- [x] I have a `<title>` specified inside the `<head>` that is unique to each page.
- [x] I have a `<link>` tag which is inside the `<head>` for linking my CSS which contains all of the CSS for my whole site
- [x] I have no inline or internal CSS.

#### Inside the `<body>` of each page
- [x] I have a navigation bar using the `<nav>` tag (possibly but not necessarily inside a `<header>` tag).
  - [x] This code can be copied and pasted to all three pages, and then changed to make it clear which page is currently active.
- [x] I have a footer using the `<footer>` tag.
  - [x] This code will typically be the same on all three pages of your site.
- [x] I have one and only one top level heading in my page using `<h1>`.
  - [x] I am aware that the different heading levels `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. are the only tags that use numbers.
  - [x] I’m aware that there can be many `<h2>` headings and that this indicates that they are “second level”.

#### Inside my CSS
- [x] I have one single CSS file that is used across all three of my pages.
- [x] If I’ve used web fonts (like those from google) I have those imported at the top of my CSS file.
- [x] I have sincerely tried to avoid repeating myself too much (and am aware that I can discuss ways to do this with my tutor in week 7).
- [x] I have used classes (and possibly IDs where appropriate) to avoid repeating myself too much.

#### Extra things
- [x] I have read the rubric and the brief and I’m aware that there are more things to do that aren’t on this list.
- [x] I’ve tested my site on someone else’s computer (e.g. emailing it as a ZIP file or using a USB drive then opening it elsewhere) to make sure that I haven’t used absolute links to files or images and haven’t used local fonts, etc.
- [x] I haven’t used JS, Bootstrap (or any framework) and the code is all my own.
- [x] If I’ve used code snippets from examples I’ve used comments in HTML and CSS to show that I understand what is going.
